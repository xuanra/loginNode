# loginNode
This creates a login page in nodejs
It's created using the tutorial in 
https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-and-understand-a-simple-nodejs-website-with-user-authentication 
page using my personal data for testing.

You can use the original page to check your personal values in order to generate a new access to your own personal login page.
